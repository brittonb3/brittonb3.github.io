  My name is Britton Baumann and I am a full stack web developer. Let me tell you how I became a web developer.

I grew up in Minnesota to a very sports minded family. I became very passionate about sports at a young age. This passion eventually lead me to play college football at the University of Minnesota Duluth. I had a great career there and was even able to break some school records. After graduating college with a sociology degree, I spent the next six years training to play professional football. I was lucky enough to have some tryouts with different teams but never stuck with a team. This is where web development comes into the picture.

When I was done playing football I had to find out what other passions I had in life. I spent the next year working as a strength coach and personal trainer. This gave me time to find out what else I was passionate about other than sports. I thought for awhile about this and web development came to mind. I have always been curious about web development but never went past curiosity.

In late 2015 I looked into web development and started to use websites different website to teach myself web development. During this process my passion grew and grew. I have always been one who loves learning and problem solving. With web development I have been able to learn, problem solve, design and create new things. This lead me to take a course through Bloc.io. The passion for learning web development kept growing everyday through this course and this has lead me to where I am today.
