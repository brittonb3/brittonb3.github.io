## Explanation

## Photography Website Portfolio

I have created my own photography portfolio website.

## Made with

* Ruby on Rails
* Bootstrap

## Features

* The main feature that sets this site apart is it only shows certain galleries on certain days. I came up with this idea to resemble an art gallery. Where they might be open for a certain time or only on display for so many weeks.
* More features are in the works.
