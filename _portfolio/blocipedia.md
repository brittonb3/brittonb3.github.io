## Explanation

## Blocipedia:
  Blocipedia is a Wikipedia replica that lets users sign in, and create wikis.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

## Made with
* Ruby on Rails
* Devise for signing up
* Bootstrap
* Pundit gem
* Stripe to charge users with premium accounts
* Redcarpet gem to parse Markdown syntax

## Blocipedia Features
* Users can create an account with devise and will receive a confirmation email.
* Users are able to create, update, and even delete wikis.
* Users can upgrade to a premium user where they can create private wikis.
* premium users can add a collaborator to a private wiki.
* If users downgrade to a standard user their private wikis become public.
